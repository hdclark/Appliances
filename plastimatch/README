This directory contains a script that simplifies DICOM image volume registration. Written by Hal Clark in 2018.

Invocation, in a nutshell, is like:

./CT_to_CT_deformable/Launch_Registration.sh -r path/to/directory/containing/reference/DICOM/images/ \
                                             -d path/to/directory/containing/deformable/DICOM/images/ \
                                             -o path/for/output/files/ \
                                             -c optional/path/to/override/default/plastimatch/command_file.txt

The input images are mapped read-only to the registration process and are not altered.
DICOM files should be at the top level in the provided directories and should end with '.dcm'.
Output DICOM files copy select information from the deformable images (patient ID, dates, UID linkages).
Additional output files contain information about each registration stage and a log of the whole process.

For more info about the registration specifics, see the default command file 
(./CT_to_CT_deformable/command_file.txt or similar).
To override the default, it is easiest to start with the default.

Note that even though CT-to-CT deformation is expected, the default registration here is meant to be used to co-register
standard CTs with contrast-enhanced CTs. This is done by using mutual information rather than MSE. 
In any case, the defaults can be easily overridden to support cross-modality registration.
